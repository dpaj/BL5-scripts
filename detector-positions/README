there should be 4 configuration tasks:
1) calibrate detector distances
2) normalize detector efficiencies
3) calculate t-zero for the choppers flux
4) calculate t-zero for the detectors

3 and 4 can be different numbers because of finite slope to moderator intensity as a function of energy

to calibrate the detector distances:
first must have done a run of an incoherent scatter

measured Attenuation Length vs. Wavelength for CNCS detectors from Kevin Barry
lambda (Å)	E (meV)	att (mm)
1	        81.81	20.92
1.5	        36.36	13.95
2	        20.45	10.46
2.5	        13.09	8.37
3	        9.09	6.97
4	        5.113	5.23
5	        3.272	4.18
6	        2.272	3.49
8	        1.278	2.62
10	        0.818	2.09

att (mm) = 20.921 / lambda

so, at 1 meV (lambda = 9.044 Å) att = 2.3132 mm
at 3.32 meV (lambda = 4.964 Å) att = 4.2145 mm
at 12.0 meV (lambda = 2.611 Å) att = 8.0126 mm

the transmission function is then
T = exp(-x/att)

this probability distribution should be normalized
P_norm = exp(-x/att) / (att - att*exp(-L/att) )

then the average penetration depth can be calculated
avg_pen = (att * np.exp(L/att) - L - a ) / (np.exp(L/a) - 1)

the tube is a square 25.4 mm object
L = 25.4 mm

the average of the penetration depth is then
integrate(P_norm, x = 0 ... L)

gives an average position (avg_pen) of 2.313 mm for a normal incidence at 1 meV, but this becomes longer out-of-plane
avg_pen = 4.154 mm at 3.32 meV
avg_pen = 5.909 mm at 12.0 meV
avg_pen = 8.736 mm at 30.0 meV
avg_pen = 10.195 mm at 80.0 meV

effective distance is then 5.350 / cos(theta) if theta is defined as the out-of-plane-angle
e.g. at 16 degrees, avg_pen = 5.565 mm, to add an additional 0.216 mm

somehow I am currently off systematically by 11 mm for the most out-of-plane detectors compared to the equatorial detectors
