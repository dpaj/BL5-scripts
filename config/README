to calibrate the detector distances:
first must have done a run of an incoherent scatter

measured Attenuation Length vs. Wavelength for CNCS detectors from Kevin Barry
lambda (Å)	E (meV)	att (mm)
1	        81.81	20.92
1.5	        36.36	13.95
2	        20.45	10.46
2.5	        13.09	8.37
3	        9.09	6.97
4	        5.113	5.23
5	        3.272	4.18
6	        2.272	3.49
8	        1.278	2.62
10	        0.818	2.09

att (mm) = 20.921 / lambda

so, at 1 meV (lambda = 9.044 Å) att = 2.3132 mm

the transmission function is then
T = exp(-x/att)

the tube is a square 25.4 mm object
integrate(x*exp(-x/att), x = 0, 25.4 mm)

gives an average position (avg_pen) of 5.34980243 mm for a normal incidence, but this becomes longer out-of-plane
effective distance is then 5.350 / cos(theta) if theta is defined as the out-of-plane-angle
e.g. at 16 degrees, avg_pen = 5.565 mm, to add an additional 0.216 mm
