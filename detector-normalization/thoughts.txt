should use the highest flux
practically with the choppers running, this means all choppers at 60Hz
could do all parked open, but may have radiation problems and maybe some other junk

1e6 counts per pixel to get 0.1% uncertainty in intensity coming from this normalization

use the Ei = 3.32 meV to get below the Bragg cutoff of Al and V

sometimes, if in a magnet (or other sample environment) and wanting to get a V normalization, Ei = 1.55 meV is run

run a thin sample to avoid multiple scattering; for example the 63 mm tall x 10 mm diameter x 1 mm thick V sample that is in Al holder

run without a cryostat to avoid the multiple scattering

assume over the small q-range that all scattering is elastic, and ignore the debye-waller
